<h1>Azure Honeynet: SOC Simulation Real-World Cyber Attacks</h1>

![image alt](https://github.com/tranxjason/Azure/blob/0b7f9e0f6b605894cf9d2a0168864c983a470888/azure%20honenet.jpg)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, a honeynet is created using Microsoft Azure to attract real-world traffic from attackers across the globe. The primary objective is to showcase security practices in cybersecurity, incident response strategies, and the impact of hardening a networked environment. To achieve this, virtual machines are deliberately deployed without protections, exposing them to the public internet and inviting malicious activity. After collecting logs into a Log Analytics Workspace, Microsoft Sentinel is used to generate attack maps, alerts, and incident reports. This setup allows us to compare metrics before and after implementing security hardening, based on incidents captured over a 24-hour period.

<h2>Azure Components Utilized</h2>

- <b>Azure Virtual Network (VNet)</b> 
- <b>Azure Network Security Group</b>
- <b>Virtual Machines (2x Windows, 1x Linux)</b>
- <b>Log Analytics Workspace with Kusto Query Language (KQL) Queries</b>
- <b>Azure Key Vault for Secure Secrets Management</b>
- <b>Azure Storage Account for Data Storage</b>
- <b>Microsoft Sentinel for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</b>
- <b>Microsoft Defender for Cloud to Protect Cloud Resources</b>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

- <b>*Creating the honeynet:* Began by deploying multiple vulnerable virtual machines in Azure, simulating an insecure environment.</b>


- <b>*Monitoring and analysis:* Azure was configured to ingest log sources from various resources into a log analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was then used to build attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents based on the collected data.</b>


- <b>*Security metrics measurement:* Observed the environment for 24 hours, recording key security metrics while it was insecure. This provided a baseline to compare against after implementing remediation measures.</b>


- <b>*Incident response and remediation:* After addressing the incidents and identifying vulnerabilities, I began the process of hardening the environment by applying security best practices and Azure-specific recommendations.</b>


- <b>*Post-remediation analysis:* Re-observed the environment for another 24 hours to measure security metrics again, comparing the results with the initial baseline.</b>

- <b>In the "BEFORE" stage of the project, all resources were initially deployed with public exposure to the internet. This setup was intentionally insecure to attract potential cyber attackers and observe their tactics. The Virtual Machines had both their Network Security Groups (NSGs) and built-in firewalls wide open, allowing unrestricted access from any source. Additionally, all other resources, such as storage accounts and databases, were deployed with public endpoints visible to the internet, without utilizing any Private Endpoints for added security.</b>

<h2>Architecture After Implementing Hardening Measures and Security Controls</h2>

In the "After" stage, based off the incidents created from the "Before" 24 hour capture, hardening measures and security controls were implemented to improve the environment's security from attackers.

These improvements included:

- <b>*Network Security Groups (NSGs):* Hardened the NSGs by only allowing my own public IP address to come thrugh otherwise all other traffic would be blocked by the new parameteres created.</b>

- <b>*Built-in Firewalls:* In the virtual machines, configured the built-in firewalls so that it would deny access from unauthorized users.</b>

- <b>*Private Endpoints:* For other Azure resources, replaced the public endpoints with private endpoints. This ensured that access to sensitive resources, such as storage accounts and databases, was limited to only the virtual network.</b>

<h2>Attack Maps After Hardening/Security Controls</h2>


`All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.`
